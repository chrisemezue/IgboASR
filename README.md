# IgboASR: End-to-End Speech Recognition for Igbo
## Motivation
This is based on our work on automatic speech recognition models for Igbo and Fon. This study led to a paper, [OkwuGbé: End-to-End Speech Recognition for Fon and Igbo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07762), accepted at the AfricaNLP workshop of EACL 2021.

OkwuGbé is a step towards building speech recognition systems for African low-resourced languages. Using Fon and Igbo as our case study, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of each language and describe the creation of end-to-end, deep neural network-based speech recognition models for both languages.
Ende-to-end automatic speech recognition model for Igbo language.

## Experiments
Here is the open-source code for the model and data preprocessing steps for Igbo language. For Fon language, see [here](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/fonasr).
